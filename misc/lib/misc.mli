val try_finalize : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> ('c -> 'd) -> 'c -> 'b

val iter_dir : (string -> 'a) -> string -> unit

val restart_on_EINTR : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b
(** Repeat a system call when it is interrupted by a signal, i.e. when the
    [EINTR] exception is raised *)

val free_children : 'a -> unit
(** Executes [waitpid] in non-blocking mode (option [WNOHANG]) to recover any
    dead children and repeats until either there are only live children (zero is
    returned instead of a child id) or there are no children ([ECHILD]
    exception) *)

val retransmit : Unix.file_descr -> Unix.file_descr -> unit
(** Reads data on the descriptor [fdin] and writes it on [fdout].  It
    terminates, without closing the descriptors, when the end of file is reached
    on the input descriptor.  Note that [retransmit] may be interrupted by a
    signal. *)

val install_tcp_server_socket : Unix.sockaddr -> Unix.file_descr
(** Creates a socket of type stream in the Internet domain with the default
    protocol and prepares it to accept new connection requests on the address
    [addr] with [bind] and [listen].  We close the socket in case of an
    error. *)

val tcp_server : (Unix.file_descr -> Unix.file_descr * Unix.sockaddr -> 'a) -> Unix.sockaddr -> unit
(** Creates a socket with [install_tcp_server_socket] and enters an infinite
    loop.  At each iteration of the loop it waits for a connection request with
    [accept] and treats it with the function [treat_connection].  We restart the
    [accept] call if it is interrupted.  We also ignore the signal [sigpipe] so
    that an unexpected disconnection raise an [EPIPE] exception that can be
    caught by [treat_connection] rather than killing the server.  Note that in
    any case it is [treat_connection]'s duty to close the [client] descriptor at
    the end of the connection.

    The function [treat_connection] is also given the descriptor of the server
    so that if it [fork]s or [double_fork]s it can be closed by the child.  *)

val sequential_treatment : 'a -> ('b -> 'c) -> 'b -> 'c

val fork_treatment : Unix.file_descr -> (Unix.file_descr * 'a -> 'b) -> Unix.file_descr * 'a -> unit
(** Delegates a service to a child process.  The child process handles the
    connection and the parent process immediately retries to [accept].

    Note that it is essential that the parent closes [client_sock], otherwise
    the close made by the child will not terminate the connection (besides the
    parent would also quickly run out of descriptors).  The descriptor is also
    closed if the fork fails, for the server may eventually decide the error is
    not fatal and continue to operate.

    Similarly, the child immediately closes the [server] descriptor on which the
    connection request was received.  First, it does not need it.  Second, the
    server may stop accepting new connections before the child has terminated.
    The call to [exit 0] is important since it ensures that the child terminates
    after the execution of the service and that it does not start to execute the
    server loop. *)

val double_fork_treatment : Unix.file_descr -> (Unix.file_descr * 'a -> 'b) -> Unix.file_descr * 'a -> unit
(** Double forks a service so that children can recovered *)

val co_treatment : Unix.file_descr -> (Unix.file_descr * 'a -> 'b) -> Unix.file_descr * 'a -> unit

val run_with_lock : Mutex.t -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b
(** Hold a lock temporarily during a function call. *)

val tcp_farm_server : int -> (Unix.file_descr -> Unix.file_descr * Unix.sockaddr -> 'a) -> Unix.sockaddr -> unit
(** The [tcp_farm_server] function behaves like tcp_server but takes an
    additional argument which is the number of threads to start, each of which
    will become a server at the same address. The advantage of a pool of threads
    is to reduce the time to handle each connection by eliminating the cost of
    creating a thread for it, since they are created once and for all. *)
